**SM64EC** is a tool created for **Super Mario 64 machinima**. The tool allows for the *quick* swapping of Mario's eye texture in-game, giving Mario more character and expression.\
The goal is to *eliminate* the constant dragging & dropping of files, or the use of *Quad64* or *ToadsTools64* for eye textures.

This tool was created in Python 3.9.5.
